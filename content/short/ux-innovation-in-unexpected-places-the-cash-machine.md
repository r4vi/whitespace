I noticed a new feature on Nationwide cash machines recently. Instead of the usual flow of:
* request pin
* ask what service you want (99.9% it's gimmie cash)
* ask how much
* get money

Nationwide have changed to to:
* request pin
* show you your favourite __actions__
* get money

This is especially useful if you tend to take out amounts of cash that aren't 
in the usual list of options.

Why wasn't this a **thing** 20 years ago?
