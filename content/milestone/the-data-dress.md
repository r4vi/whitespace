At a [hackathon][s6] that happened to overlap London Fashion Week, our team decided to
create a [dress][dress] from the pictures that were being uploaded to instagram and flickr
tagged with the #lfw hashtag, with the view to completing the dress and taking it to
Somerset House for a [photo shoot][ps] and (the venue for LFW) to show it off before the event finished.

The dress was eventually exhibited at the Whitechapel Gallery. Photo credit: [Paul Clarke](http://www.flickr.com/photos/paul_clarke/sets/72157631566327049/)
